The console paint program. Ascii Artist has been a long time project. It's gone through numerous rewrites and changes. It's goal is to allow users to create graphics to insert into their console programs. Although it usually just ends up as a makeshift level editor.

This project isn't well documented yet. Everything should be able to run but not everything is explained outside of looking through the code. I'll get back to fixing this up later.
