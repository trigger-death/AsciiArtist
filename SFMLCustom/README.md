# SFMLCustom

A fork of [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) to provide special needs for the [AsciiVis](../AsciiVis) program. This library still depends on the the SFML library distribution for building.

It's been too long to remember what exact changes were made, but they most likely included adding more accessors and mutators that were otherwise locked behind a private wall.
