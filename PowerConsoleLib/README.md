# PowerConsole

The base framework for Ascii console programs using the `.asc` Ascii Image file format.

* The v5 implementation's API is based around the WPF framework.
* Includes many wrappers around the Console WINAPI, and handles low level console state.
* Ensures console is in expected configuration mode at startup, and can restore settings after exiting properly.
